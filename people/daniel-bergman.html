	  I am a mathematics PhD student at UC Irvine. I received a B.S. in mathematics and a minor in physics from Cal State Long Beach where I developed an interest in algebraic geometry. After two years abroad in China, I came to UCI planning on continuing studies in algebra, but after coming across Dr. Nieâ€™s lab I was drawn in to the opportunity for doing cancer research. In the short time since that transition, I have been specifically studying cancer-immunology, creating models of how the innate and adaptive immune systems both play paradoxical roles in cancer growth. My goal is to elucidate mechanisms by which the immune system potentially exhibits both cancer-promoting and cancer-suppressing activities. I also have an interest in cancer dormancy and how the immune system regulates that process.
