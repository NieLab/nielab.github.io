      I am PhD student in Geophysics, Stanford University and in Computational Mathemathics,
      Link&ouml;ping University, Sweden. My advisors are <a href="https://pangea.stanford.edu/~edunham/">Eric M. Dunham<a>
          (Stanford) and <a href="http://users.mai.liu.se/janno11/">Jan Nordstr&ouml;m</a> (Linkoping University). I am
expected to graduate in the end of 2016. In my research I focus on the development of high-order numerical methods for wave
propagation in solids containing faults and fluid-filled fractures.

The following paragraphs explains more about my research that I conducted during my PhD. It is the abstract of my PhD
thesis (work in progress).
      </p>

      <p>
This thesis develops numerical methods for the simulation of wave propagation in solids containing faults and
fluid-filled fractures. These techniques have applications in earthquake hazard analysis, seismic imaging of
reservoirs, and volcano seismology. A central component of this work is the coupling of mechanical systems. This
aspect involves the
coupling of both ordinary differential equations (ODE)s and partial differential equations (PDE)s along curved interfaces.   
All of these problems satisfy a mechanical energy balance. This mechanical energy balance is mimicked by the numerical scheme using high-order
accurate difference
approximations that satisfy the principle of summation by parts, and by weakly enforcing the coupling conditions. 
      </p>

      <p>
The first part of the thesis considers the simulation of dynamic earthquake ruptures along non-planar fault geometries
and the simulation of seismic wave radiation from earthquakes, when the earthquakes are idealized as point moment tensor sources. The dynamic earthquake rupture process is simulated by
coupling the elastic wave equation at a fault interface to nonlinear ODEs that describe the fault mechanics. The fault
geometry is complex and treated by combining structured and unstructured grid techniques. In other applications, when
the earthquake source dimension is smaller than wavelengths of interest, the earthquake can be accurately described by
a point moment tensor source localized at a single point. The numerical challenge is to discretize the point source
with high-order accuracy and without producing spurious oscillations.
      </p>

      <p>
The second part of the thesis presents a numerical method for wave propagation in and around fluid-filled fractures. This
problem requires the coupling of the elastic wave equation to a fluid inside curved and branching fractures in the
solid. The fluid model is a lubrication approximation that incorporates fluid inertia, compressibility, and viscosity. The fracture geometry can have local irregularities such
as constrictions and tapered tips. The numerical method discretizes the fracture geometry by using
curvilinear multiblock grids and applies implicit-explicit time stepping to isolate and overcome stiffness 
arising in the semi-discrete equations from viscous diffusion terms, fluid compressibility, and the particular
enforcement of the fluid-solid coupling conditions.
 This numerical method is applied to study the interaction of waves in a fracture-conduit
system. A methodology to constrain fracture geometry for oil and gas (hydraulic fracturing) and volcano seismology
applications is proposed.
      </p>

      <p>
The third part of the thesis extends the summation-by-parts methodology to staggered grids. This extension reduces
numerical dispersion and enables the formulation of stable and high-order accurate multiblock discretizations for wave
equations in first order form on staggered grids. Finally, the summation-by-parts methodology on staggered grids is
further extended to second derivatives and used for the treatment of coordinate singularities in axisymmetric wave
propagation.
