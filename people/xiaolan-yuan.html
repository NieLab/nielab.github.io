	  I am a Ph.D. student in the department of mathematics of UC Irvine. Previously, I earned my B.S in school of mathematics and statistics in Wuhan University in China from 2011 to 2015, and I was in MASS (Mathematics Advanced Study Semesters) Program in Penn State University in 2014.

	  I am currently working on noise attenuation in different biological circuits models. Based on previous study of certain transcription network loops in cells (e.g., feedback loops), one of the new goals is to understand why a more complicated loop system shows good properties and to find crucial quantities highly linked to noise attenuation in the loop system.

	  Before joining the Nie Lab, I also worked on my undergraduate research of developing highly accurate methods for Hamiltonian System with multiple time scales and simulating the change of movement and total energy with respect to time of macromolecules in Penn State University.
