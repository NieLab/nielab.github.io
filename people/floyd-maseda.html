	  I have been a PhD student in math at UCI since Fall 2015 and a member of the Nie lab since Winter 2018. I received a bachelor's degree in physics with a minor in math from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2012 and a master's in physics from the University of Alabama in 2014 before switching disciplines to (applied) math and coming to UCI in 2015. While here, I have received a master's in math and am on track to receive a PhD by 2021.

	  My area of research interest is finding applications for machine learning techniques on gene expression data, the most prominent of which is attempting to more accurately impute spatial information onto non-spatial scRNA-seq or similar data using a small reference atlas of known genes.
