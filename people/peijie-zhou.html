			I joined in Nie lab at UC Irvine since August 2019. I received my Ph.D. (2019) and B.S. Degree (2014) in Computational Mathematics in Peking University, China,  where I worked with Professor Tiejun Li on multi-scale stochastic modelling in systems biology. I have worked on landscape theory in biochemical systems, as well as dynamical systems approaches in single-cell data analysis. My current interest is to combine both data-driven and model-based methods to investigate the complex emergent phenomenon in biological systems across different scales.
