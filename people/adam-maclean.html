       I am a member of the Nie Lab at UCI since I joined the group in September 2016. I have previously worked in the <a href="http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/">Theoretical Systems Biology</a> group at Imperial College London, and at the <a href="http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a> at the University of Oxford.

      My research focusses on stem cells, and questions regarding their function, dynamics, and regulation. Individual stem cell decisions (self-renewal, differentiation, death) must be coordinated at the level of the population and the tissue in order to maintain homeostasis. This is particularly important in high-turnover tissues such as blood, guts, and skin. At multiple scales, including the tissue, the cell, and the subcellular molecular networks, complex and noisy nonlinear dynamics emerge. I develop mathematical and computational tools in order to study these systems and illuminate their core mechanisms. These are rooted in dynamical systems theory, inverse problems (Bayesian inference), and applied mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
      Application of these tools allows us to address important biological questions. For example, in hematopoietic stem cell biology we study how stem cells maintain the blood system and how they respond during infection. This requires high spatiotemporal resolution that we obtain by tracking single stem cells in vivo. We can also study cancer in the context of stem cells, i.e., we consider the ecology of cancer, whereby healthy stem cells respond to and compete with malignant cells that have undergone transformation. We use these models to predict both the mechanisms of cancer progression and the best therapeutic strategies to employ. For the latter, we have found that maintenance of a healthy stem cell population is more important than direct killing of leukemia cells.
</p>
<p>
Current data (single cell RNAseq, barcoding, etc) allow us to probe cellular states in greater detail than ever before. By analysis of mechanistic models in light of these data we distill insight into the tightly regulated transcriptional programs that underlie stem cell phenotype. For example, we can investigate how a balance of cell division, differentiation, and migration allows for both tissue homeostasis and response to an external perturbation (such as a bleed, wound, or infection). I am also fascinated by the transitions between cellular states (such as from quiescent to cycling, or from epithelial to mesenchymal), and seek new ways to describe and characterise their dynamics.

<h3>Background/Bio</h3>
<p>
I have held research positions as a Postdoctoral Research Associate  in the <a href="http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/">Theoretical Systems Biology Group</a> at Imperial College London (2015-2016) and in the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Mathematical Institute</a> at the University of Oxford (2014). I completed my PhD in the Theoretical Systems Biology Group: my thesis is entitled <i>Modelling haematopoietic stem cells in their niche</i>. I have also completed a BSc in <a href="http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/">Mathematical Physics</a> at the University of Edinburgh (graduating 2009 with first class honours) and an MSc in <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/pgprospectus/facultiesanddepartments/lifesciences/postgraduatecourses/bioinformatics">Bioinformatics and Theoretical Systems Biology</a> at Imperial College London (graduating 2010 with distinction).
</p><p>
Outside of research I am passionate about writing, communication, and combinations thereof. I have helped to curate events including the <a href="http://sse.royalsociety.org/2013/exhibits/clever-microbes/">Summer Science Exhibition</a> and <a href="http://imaginemedicine.com/">Imagining the Future of Medicine</a>. I have co-edited a <a href="http://londonist.com/tags/short-fiction">short fiction column</a> at Londonist.
