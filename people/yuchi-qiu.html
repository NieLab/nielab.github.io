	  I am a Ph.D student in the department of mathematics at UCI since October 2014. I joined Nie Lab in July 2015. I got my Bachelor degree in Mathematics from Nanjing University on July 2014. Currently, my research interest is numerical analysis and biological modeling. 
	  </p>
	  <p>
My focus for numerical analysis is to develop a fast and efficient algorithm for stiff reaction diffusion equations. One paper is under writing now. And I focus the growth control on a cell lineage model.
