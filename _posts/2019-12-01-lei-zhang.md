We recently published the result of our collaboration with former lab member Lei Zhang in _Cell Systems_: [Network topologies that can achieve dual function of adaptation and noise attenuation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2019.08.006). Professor Zhang is currently an Associate Professor at the Beijing International Center for Mathematical Research, for more information visit his English language [website](http://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/~zhanglei/indexE.html).
