Our paper [A mathematical model of mechanotransduction reveals how mechanical memory regulates mesenchymal stem cell fate decisions](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12918-017-0429-x) is published today in BMC Systems Biology.

In the research, a model of the regulation of mesenchymal stem cell fate by mechanical stimuli predicts that striking new memory effects are observed, whereby stem cells can be directed towards a particular fate due to past mechanical stimuli even for significant times beyond the duration of the stimuli acting on stem cells. These predictions have immediate relevance for the control of mesenchymal stem cell fate in culture or in a translational setting. 

Congratulations to [Tao]({{site.baseurl}}/people/tao-peng) who led the study with co-first author Linan Liu.
