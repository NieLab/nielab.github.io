Our paper [Cell Sorting and Noise-Induced Cell Plasticity Coordinate to Sharpen Boundaries between Gene Expression Domains](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005307) is published today in PloS Computational Biology.

Congratulations to [Qixuan]({{site.baseurl}}/people/qixuan-wang) who led the study with co-first author William Holmes.
